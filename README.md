# Systems-Programming-assignments
My solutions of the assignments of Systems Programming class in my University

### Project 1
Programm for processing data and answering questions about vaccination of citizens. 
I've implemented hashtables, bloom filters, lists and skip lists to optimize the performance.

### Project 2
Programm that create processes and communicate through pipes. 
Also, use of low level I/O's and signals. I've written a bash script to handle easier the input data.

### Project 3
Use of threads and sockets instead of processes and pipes, like the 2nd assignment.
